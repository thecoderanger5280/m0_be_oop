# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
### Really good I enjoyed these Challenges!
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
### I am staying focused pretty well and my workflow is going pretty good, I am taking breaks when I need them.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
### Just some understanding that I need some breaks every now and again.
